#  **Lab 300 - Part A: Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) Development Workshop**

# **HCM and EBS Integration: Fusion HCM with ATOM Feeds Development Lab**
> ***Last Updated: March 2019***  

## **Introduction**

> This lab is part of a series of OIC Development workshops created to provide users with hands-on experience building functional integrations in the cloud using Oracle Integration Cloud. In this lab, we will configure the connections and other parts of OIC that will be utilized in Lab 300B. This lab assumes that you are already somewhat familiar with the OIC interface and logged into the instance.

> In this lab, you create an integration using the Scheduled Integration Orchestration. The integratio will be responsyble for synhronizing a newly created employee in HCM into EBS.

> The OIC integration that we'll be building is shown in the following picture:

![](images/300/image000.png)

> Here is a description of what is happening with this integration:

 > After a new employee has been created in Oracle HCM Cloud, an HCM Atom feeds is triggered by the Scheduled Integration. HCM Atom feeds provide notifications of Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM) events. When an event occurs in Oracle Fusion HCM, the corresponding Atom feed is delivered automatically to the Atom server. This feed contains details of the REST resource in which the event occurred. Subscribers who consume these Atom feeds use the REST resources to retrieve additional information about the resource; in our case it is a newly created employee. After this is completed, the employee is synchronized with the EBS application using the EBS connector and proper mapping.


## **Objectives**

> 1. Set up HCM Adapter.
> 2. Set up EBS Adapter.
> 3. Create Scheduled Integration.
> 4. Configure the HCM Connection.
> 5. Add a Function Call.
> 6. Configure Mapping.

## **Required Artifacts**

### **300a.4: Configure the HCM Connection**
- Hover over the plus sign and search for the HCM connection name that you created previously.

 ![](images/300/1.png)

- Right after the _Configure Oracle HCM Cloud Endpoint_ wizard will pop up.

 ![](images/300/2.png)

 - In the *Basic Info* section give the endpoint a name like `Get-HCM-Atom-Feed`.

 - After giving the invocation a name, select the *Next* button.

![](images/300/3.png)

- In the *Web Services* section select *Subscribe to Updates(via ATOM feed)*. That option allows to receive latest updates since a specific date on new hires, jobs etc. Select the *Next* button.

![](images/300/4.png)

- In the *Operations* section select _Employee New Hire_ as an atom feed. Afer, make sure you check the box for  _Include Business Object in the Event Notifications (ATOM Feeds)_. Select the *Next* button.

![](images/300/5.png)

- In the *Summary* section of the configuration wizard, review the HCM connection which is going to be used, then select the *Done* button.

![](images/300/6.png)
![](images/300/7.png)

### **300a.5: Add a Function Call**
- If you click on mapping sign.

![](images/300/8.png)

- You are going to see _updated-min_ variable that is needed to be added for successful HCM invoking on the right side. The left side represents parameters that are coming from our Scheduled Integration.

![](images/300/9.png)

- Therefore, in order make a mapping for _updated-min_ variable we need to create a Function Call.

- Close the mapping window.
- Select a plus sign right after Schedule and search for _Function_.

![](images/300/10.png)

- In Create Action insert `GetTimeStamp` name.

![](images/300/11.png)

- After selecting **Create** you are going to see the window as shown below.

![](images/300/12.png)

- Before selecting a Function make sure that function exists in Library.

---

-  If you have addTime function to appear in the list of functions in the Library, skip that section.

- Create a JavaScript (.js) file and save it in your PC

```
function addTime(ts, z) {
 var d = new Date(ts); 
 d.setMinutes(d.getMinutes() - z);
 var dt = d.toISOString();
  return dt;
}

```

- Navigate to **Library** from Designer Home page.

![](images/300/13.png)


- Then select **Register**.

- In _Register Library_ wizard select the .js file that you just created and insert the required **Name**. Select the Create button.

![](images/300/14.png)

- By selecting **Orchestration** as a _Classification Type_, the fields for _Input_ and _Output_ will be prepopulated.

![](images/300/15.png)

- Save and Close the window.

Now you can access that Function from your Integration Function Action.

![](images/300/16.png)

- Come back to your Scheduled Integration

- Select Function button

![](images/300/17.png)

- Pick an appropriate function.

![](images/300/18.png)

- Add Value to your _ts_ Parametr.

![](images/300/19.png)

- Open **Function** folder and find **String Folder**

![](images/300/20.png)

- There you can find _concat_ function. Select, drag, and drop it.

![](images/300/21.png)

- At the end you want your expression looked like that picture bellow.

```
concat( substring-before( /nssrcmpr:schedule/nssrcmpr:startTime, "."),".000Z")
```
![](images/300/22.png)

- Validate and Close the window.

- Add Value to _z_ Parameter 

![](images/300/23.png)

- Assign 10.0 as an Expression. 

![](images/300/24.png)

- Validate and Close the window.

- Validate your Function and Close the window.

![](images/300/25.png)


### **300a.6 Mapping**
- Now it's time to configure the mapping between the timestamp and the Atom feed.

- Open the **Map** as it shown below.

![](images/300/26.png)

- And make a connection by dragging and dropping a point from the fuction call `GetTimeStamp` to _updated-min_ variable from HCM connection. That time stamp is needed so the system will know what point in time it should refer to to load new employees.

![](images/300/27.png)

- Validate the mapping and Close the window

### **300a.7: Assign a Variable**
- To assign a variable, click on the flag icon 

<img src="images/500b/image016.png" width="120px">  

- Drag and drop the Assign Icon (found under the Data label) to the integration flow directly under the _getNewHireATOMFeed_ icon

<img src="images/500b/image018.png" width="410px"> --> 
<img src="images/500b/image015.png" width="110px">

- A window will open where you will provide the action with a unique name _AtomFeedResponseCount_ and if you'd like a short description then click the Create button

![](images/500b/image019.png)  

- On the config page set the following values:

![](images/500b/image020.png)

- On the variable column, select countOfNewHires_assignment_1 from the dropdown
- Set Data Type as string
- The description is optional: _Count the # of new employees returned_
- Select the pencil to edit the Value. 
- Select from _Components_ Functions -> Node-set -> count. And drop it to _Expression_ window.

![](images/500b/image020a.png)

- In the expression builder you will drag and drop it to _Expression_ window the `EmployeeNewHireFeedFeed_Update` array that is coming from HCM. Your expression at the end should look like `count($Get-Atom-Feed/nsmpr3:EmployeeNewHireFeedResponse/nsmpr3:EmployeeNewHireFeed_UpdateSet)`

![](images/500b/image020b.png)
![](images/500b/image020c.png)

- Validate the Expression and Close the window.
